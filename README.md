### Hi there! <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/863a0e95-60f1-41a2-b0d9-6b5971c506c2" width="30" height="auto" />

I’m Jeremiah, a creative programmer and Digital Media Master's student in Atlanta.

I currently study @ Georgia Tech, where I focus on game design and analysis, interactive systems, and experimental approaches to interaction and meaning-making in digital media. My work often sits at the intersection of code, play, and theory, blending technical systems with expressive and speculative design.

I build interactive experiences across games, creative coding projects, and mobile apps—often exploring mechanics as arguments and systems that shape player behavior and interpretation.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy songwriting on my guitar, playing video games, exploring digital art, and getting lost in a good book.
